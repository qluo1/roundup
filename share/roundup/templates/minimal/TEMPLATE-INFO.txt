Name: minimal
Description: This is an empty tracker - it must be customised for it to be
             useful! It only defines the bare minimum of information - the
             user database and the two default users (admin and anonymous).
             The rest is entirely up to you! Not recommended for first-time
             Roundup users (it's easier to tweak the Classic tracker).
Intended-For: Roundup experts who need a clean slate to start with.
