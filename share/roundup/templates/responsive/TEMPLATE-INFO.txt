Name: responsive
Description: This issue tracker uses the same schema as devel.
            The difference between devel and responsive templates
            is the use of Twitter bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
            in templates and HTML5 markup.
	    Make sure the "static_files" setting in your config.ini of your
            instance is set to the directory where the static files live
            (the subdirectory "static" in the default of the template).
Intended-For: Developers
